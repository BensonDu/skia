Skia is a complete 2D graphic library for drawing Text, Geometries, and Images.

See full details, and build instructions, at https://skia.org.


## Notes:
- ndk=23, so have android-23 installed in ndk (ndk/platforms/android-23/)
    * so if you build >= M you'll get references to stdin/stdout/stderr. if you build < M, you'll get references to __sF instead. glibc (afaik) only has stdin/stdout/stderr symbols. 

-build-arm64.sh to build for arm64
